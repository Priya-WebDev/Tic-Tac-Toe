# Tic-Tac-Toe [Visit My Website] (https://flourishing-monstera-20bd42.netlify.app/)
This web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game is built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS for styling), and JavaScript. It offers a simple and interactive experience where two players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid.

Features:

Gameplay Interface:
Upon opening the game, players are greeted with a bold "TIC-TAC-TOE" title at the top center of the page.
There are two sections: one for displaying the current player's turn and another section containing the game board with nine clickable boxes arranged in a 3x3 grid.
Each box represents a cell on the game board where players can place their marks (X or O).

Player Interaction:
Players take turns clicking on the empty boxes to place their marks.
The current player is indicated above the game board, displaying either "Player-X" or "Player-O."
Game Logic:

The JavaScript code manages the game's logic, including tracking player turns, checking for a winner after each move, and determining a draw.
The checkWinner() function assesses the game board for win conditions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) or a draw.

End Game Conditions:
When a player wins, a message appears announcing the winner.
In case of a draw, it announces "It's a Draw!" indicating that no player has won.

Reset Functionality:
A "Reset Game" button is available at the bottom. Clicking this button resets the game board, allowing players to start a new game.

How to Play:
Players take turns clicking on the empty boxes to place their respective marks.
The game continues until one player wins by getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or until all boxes are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.

Conclusion:
This Tic-Tac-Toe game provides a straightforward yet engaging experience for two players. It demonstrates basic game mechanics and logic for a timeless and well-known game.
